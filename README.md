SlyPi
=====

This is a work in progress tool designed to run on the Raspberry Pi to have it act as a penetration testing drop box.

This has been written to interface with the 16x2 LCD + Keypad that connects to the raspberry pi. Options can be selected on the LCD screen using the keypad.

**Current ideas:**

-Passive sniffer between two devices. http://jamesdotcom.com/?p=400

-Mass network printer

-ARP Cache Spoofing

-Reverse SSH Tunnel

-Denial of service with Deauth Flooding

-Upside-Down-Tenet (Maybe something like http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html)

-Automatic Nmap scan and log file upload.
